# HandGestureRecognition

This repository contains the implementation of a Hand Gesture Recognition system using MediaPipe, OpenCV, and LSTM Neural Networks. The project is designed to capture and recognize human gestures in real-time, providing a foundation for gesture-based interaction systems.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection and recognition.
- Keypoint extraction using MediaPipe Holistic.
- LSTM Neural Network for gesture classification.
- Interactive visualization of predictions and keypoints.
- Live testing and evaluation with accuracy metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- MediaPipe: For pose and gesture tracking.
- OpenCV: For video processing and visualization.
- TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the LSTM model.
- Scikit-learn: For preprocessing and evaluation.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing the results.
